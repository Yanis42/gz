## HackerGZ branch

I wanna try to cleanup things in here because I don't like how it looks like, but no idea if the changes in here will be enjoyed upstream but I don't really mind, it's fun to do in any case.

Goals:
- use a formatter
- move headers to a separate folder
- rename every structs, variable etc to be consistent with names from [zeldaret/oot](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot)
- cool terminal output (because why not?)
- maybe more stuff if something else comes to my mind

Feel free to make suggestions.

Also I added a baby safety involving ``md5sum`` to make sure I don't break anything on accident, create the sums with ``make gensums`` and verify with ``make verify``.
